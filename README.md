# Tech-Me

[![Validate Tech-Me](https://github.com/L4ncelotz/tech-me-skills/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/L4ncelotz/tech-me-skills/actions/workflows/validate.yml)

**Evidence-based technical architecture decisions, without the stack bias.**

Tech-Me is a portable Agent Skill that interviews you **only as much as needed**, evaluates requirements and hard constraints before choosing technologies, challenges architectural assumptions, and explains the trade-offs behind its recommendation.

> Discover requirements. Challenge assumptions. Design with evidence.

[Agent Skills format](https://agentskills.io/specification) · [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh/docs/cli)

## What it does

- **Adaptive discovery:** asks one high-impact question at a time and stops when information is sufficient. “Recommend now” is always valid.
- **Bias-controlled evaluation:** separates requirements and hard constraints from a user's past stacks and preferences.
- **Constraint-first design:** filters non-viable choices before comparing credible alternatives.
- **Reasonable defaults:** handles unknown answers without endless questioning; labels assumptions instead of inventing facts.
- **Evidence proportional to risk:** checks fast-changing claims with available tools, or flags uncertainty.
- **Existing-project awareness:** inspects relevant, accessible non-secret codebase materials when available, read-only by default.
- **Architecture quality gate:** challenges overengineering, migration cost, operational risk and unjustified dependencies.
- **Clear decision report:** leads with the recommendation, then alternatives, trade-offs, risks, and revisit triggers.
- **Portable core:** a single `SKILL.md` works without MCP servers or external dependencies. Optional capabilities degrade gracefully.

## Install

Published as `L4ncelotz/tech-me-skills` on GitHub (see [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md)):

```bash
npx skills add L4ncelotz/tech-me-skills --skill tech-me
```

For local development (from the repository root):

```bash
npx skills add ./skills/tech-me
```

The skills CLI may prompt for an agent and install location. Automatic activation and command naming vary by agent; the portable contract is the skill metadata and instructions, **not** a guaranteed `/tech-me` slash command on every platform.

## Use

Ask your agent, for example:

```text
Use Tech-Me. I want to build a small internal inventory application.
Help me choose a maintainable architecture. Ask only necessary questions.
```

```text
Use Tech-Me to review our current backend architecture.
Do not edit code. Identify evidence for or against moving to microservices.
```

```text
Use Tech-Me. Compare SQLite and PostgreSQL for my offline-first app.
Recommend now using reasonable assumptions instead of a long interview.
```

### Example conversation (illustrative, not a benchmark)

**User:** I want to make an inventory web app for my company.

**Tech-Me:** Will this be used only by employees, or also by customers? That affects access control and hosting.

**User:** Employees only. Maybe 20 people.

**Tech-Me:** Is there an existing database or server that you must use?

**User:** We have a Windows Server and Oracle.

**Tech-Me:** Those are important constraints. I'll use them to assess the simplest viable architecture, rather than proposing a new hosting platform by default.

## Validate and evaluate

Requires Python 3.10+ **for repository validation only**, not for running the skill itself.

```bash
# 1. Structural validation and unit tests
python scripts/validate_repo.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

# 2. Evaluation harness inspection (dry-run) or fixture preparation
python scripts/run_evals.py --dry-run
python scripts/run_evals.py --prepare-fixtures --output dist/prepared_fixtures.json
```

Fixture output goes to git-ignored `dist/` so an untracked fixture file can never dirty the working tree and block release packaging (`pack_release.py` requires a clean tree).

Optional upstream specification validation if `skills-ref` is installed:

```bash
skills-ref validate ./skills/tech-me
```

Validation is organized into two distinct layers:

1. **Structural Validation (`scripts/validate_repo.py`, `tests/`)**: Offline, zero-dependency deterministic checks verifying YAML frontmatter, relative reference integrity, and evaluation scenario schema conformity. (Note: this is not a substitute for the upstream `skills-ref` specification validator).
2. **Behavioral Evaluation Suite (`evals/`)**: Scenario-based qualitative evaluations comparing baseline and skill-enabled model behavior against `evals/RUBRIC.md`. The initial evaluated run (`evals/runs/run_20261029_step6.json`) documents three sampled scenarios under a single model configuration (`google-antigravity/gemini-3.8-flash`) evaluated on 2026-10-29 (see [Evaluation Results](evals/RESULTS.md)). These findings characterize specific prompt behaviors under fixed parameters and do **not** imply cross-agent certification across arbitrary client runtimes (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code, Cline), for which multi-agent empirical testing is ongoing prior to v1.0. See [Evaluation Runbook](evals/RUNBOOK.md).
## Design boundaries

- No required web search, MCP server, subscription, or runtime dependency.
- No automatic file changes, package installs, or deployments.
- No requirement to use a particular framework, vendor, cloud, or language.
- No claim to guarantee the objectively optimal architecture. Recommendations depend on evidence and requirements.
